This is my First R Markdown.
I have included datasets for diamonds and executed a plot of carat to price based on their clarity. 


The clarity are of 6 types

1.Flawless[F].

2.Internally Flawless[IF].

3.Very Slightly Included[VS1,VS2].

4.Very Very Slightly Included[VVS1,VVS2].

5.Slightly Included[S1,S2,S2].

6.Included[I1,I2,I3].
